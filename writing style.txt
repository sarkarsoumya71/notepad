All right how about this that we still use the line its clear to me the “it's clear to me that the substance of uh your conversations are second to none” but now we rewrite it as “given your recent a podcast given to your recent given your recent podcast episode or given you given your recent episode it's clear to me that the substance of this conversation is second to none especially your point about dot dot dot whatever the points might be I highly resonated with this how how” how about we do it this way and maybe we can reframe it or refreeze it better let's say if you have some suggestions for refreezing it and you can use an example you know make a sample personalized line first line so we can go ahead goes with something along those lines that I really liked your you know something like I really liked your recent episode or no the in your recent episode you spoke about this it really resonated with this and it's clear to me that the you know the discontent of this you know content of substance of your conversation is second to none my concern and then we can go ahead with the rest of the e-mail how does that sound

All right here's what I want to know read that when I'm emailing the podcast host because that's why I'm emailing to make it personal like throughout the podcast the guest is speaking right so I can only add personalization through that aspect and if and if I do that oh you if I say to the podcast host that oh yeah you carry the conversation really nicely that will be too generic uh but so we won't go there but what we what I want you to do is think for me how could I use whatever is has been is is said by the guest to um I know how to show the podcast who is who I am emailing that you know to prove that oh I've actually listened to your podcast and I actually really enjoyed it for example I'm pasting us you know for example if the podcast guest talked about who how they like to be transparent with their sales and I really like that point how do I see that in such a way that like I'm kind of talking to the podcast host who I'm emailing but I'm using the statement by the podcast guest to tell them what did I like to talk to the podcast host to prove that oh I've actually listened to your podcast and I really like this point without sort of you know negating or dismissing the podcast host uh do you get my point

I will get you their exact quoted lines later for now but for now ocmeup with a reposnse with twhatever I said, thanks!

I understand - you want to craft an opening that shows you've genuinely listened to the podcast while appropriately addressing the host, using the guest's insights as reference points. Here's a natural way to approach this:

"I recently listened to your conversation with [Guest Name] where they shared their approach to sales transparency. Their point about [specific insight] really struck a chord with me, and I appreciated how you drew out these valuable perspectives through your thoughtful questions."

This approach works well because it:

References specific content from the guest
Acknowledges the host's role in facilitating the conversation
Shows genuine engagement with the content
Maintains focus on the host while using the guest's insights as evidence of listening
When you have the exact quotes from the guest, we can make this even more specific and impactful. Would you like me to refine this further once you have those specific quotes?

Me

So I really liked how you acknowledged the podcast host one thing though the phrase you used through your thoughtful questions” this whole phrase sounds like you know unwanted unnecessary unwarranted flattery it doesn't sound authentic rather it sounds very gimmicky and sort of marketing fluff rather what I want you to do is umm consider these two points thank him for bringing in guests like these and asking questions or having conversations that lead to insights like these either you can address them separately or you can connect there's two pointers the phrasing doesn't have to be exactly like that but that should be the ii'm hoping that you have gotten the idea main idea

make sure, it sounds authetnci, human like and not market fluff, gimmicky

Ah yes, I see where I went wrong with that marketing-like flattery. Here's a more authentic way to acknowledge both the guest's insights and the host's role:

"I recently listened to your conversation with [Guest Name], and their perspective on sales transparency really resonated with me. It's refreshing to hear discussions like these that dive into the practical realities of [topic]. Thanks for bringing guests who share such honest insights."

Or another variation:

"Your recent episode with [Guest Name] caught my attention, particularly when they discussed their approach to sales transparency. These kinds of candid conversations are exactly what [industry/topic] needs, and I appreciate you creating space for them."

Both versions:

Stay genuine without forced flattery
Acknowledge the host's contribution naturally
Use the guest's insights as proof of listening
Sound like something a real person would say
Avoid marketing fluff or gimmicky phrases
Would you like me to try other variations that maintain this authentic tone?

Me

'who share such honest insights.' - too flattery, a simple thank for bringing in such guests is enough (you can add a bit more though but it shouldn't be flattery)

You're absolutely right - let me revise to be more straightforward and genuine:

"I recently listened to your conversation with [Guest Name], and their perspective on sales transparency really resonated with me. It's refreshing to hear discussions like these that dive into the practical realities of [topic]. Thanks for bringing in such guests."

Or even simpler:

"Your recent episode with [Guest Name] caught my attention, particularly when they discussed their approach to sales transparency. These kinds of candid conversations are exactly what [industry/topic] needs. Thanks for bringing guests like these to your show."

Now it:

Stays genuine and straightforward
Thanks the host simply without unnecessary praise
Maintains focus on the content value
Sounds like natural human speech
Does this better match the tone you're looking for?

Me

a better phrase than 'caught my attention', don't use the word approach, use something else....remove 'candid'

Here's the refined version:

"Your recent episode with [Guest Name] really resonated with me, particularly their insights on sales transparency. These conversations are exactly what [industry/topic] needs. Thanks for bringing guests like these to your show."

Or another way:

"I listened to your episode with [Guest Name], and their thoughts on sales transparency really hit home. These kinds of discussions are exactly what [industry/topic] needs. Thanks for bringing guests like these to your show."

Now it:

Uses more natural phrases ("really resonated," "hit home")
Removes formal/business-speak words
Keeps it simple and authentic
Maintains genuine appreciation without flattery
Which version feels more natural to you?

Me

ok, now let's start with our first email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider these pointers, since they are pretty much the same  we can club them together and referto them as one:

"Research is the only way we have to double check what the commercial advertisement asks us to trust in."

"The companies want us to buy the products and what they rely on is telling us something and us taking it at face value, whereas we need to understand exactly what's going on."

"I really trust that research is the only way we have to double check what the commercial advertisement asks us to trust in."
'''
se these templates please (you're free to make relevant tweaks):

- Your recent episode on [Episode Topic] – specifically the <mark style="background: #D22B2B;">segment</mark> on [Specific Point] – really resonated with me.
- I wanted to reach out after your latest episode on [Episode Topic]. The way you <mark style="background: #D22B2B;">unpacked</mark> [Specific Point] was incredibly nuanced and thought-provoking.
- I just finished watching your recent episode on [Episode Topic], and the discussion of [Specific Point] is what really got my attention.
- I just finished your recent episode about [Topic], and that discussion on [Point] really stuck with me.
- You know, I was listening to your recent episode about [Topic], and when you got into [Point], it really <mark style="background: #D22B2B;">hit home</mark>. 
- I recently listened to your conversation with [Guest Name], and their perspective on sales transparency really resonated with me. It's refreshing to hear discussions like these that dive into the practical realities of [topic]. Thanks for bringing in such guests.
- I listened to your episode with [Guest Name], and their thoughts on sales transparency really hit home. These kinds of discussions are exactly what [industry/topic] needs. Thanks for bringing guests like these to your show.


Based on those quotes about research and commercial advertising, and using the templates you've provided, here's a natural, personalized opening:

"I listened to your episode with [Guest Name], and their thoughts on research being our only reliable way to verify commercial claims really hit home. Their point about not taking advertising at face value, but instead understanding what's actually happening, reflects exactly what [industry/topic] needs. Thanks for bringing guests like these to your show."

Or a slightly different version:

"I just finished your recent episode about commercial advertising verification, and that discussion on using research to fact-check marketing claims really stuck with me. The conversation highlighted how we often take company claims at face value, when we should be digging deeper to understand what's really going on. Thanks for bringing guests who encourage this kind of critical thinking."

Would you like me to try other variations? Also, once you provide the guest name and specific industry/topic, we can make it even more precise.

Me

this was perfect! ok, now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider these pointers

1. **On the Power of Gratitude:** ✅
    
    > "I believe that the secret to life and fulfillment is giving and gratitude."
    
2. **On Team as Assets:** ✅
    
    > "You can either see teams one of two ways—you can either see them as an asset or a liability. I choose to see my team as an asset."
    
3. **On the Importance of Teamwork:** ✅
    
    > "Teamwork Makes the Dream Work and I say teamwork and teams make the dreams become reality."

 **On Building Strong Teams:** ✅
    
    > "Having someone who's a ride or die with you that you know you can count on is something that we don't take for granted."
    
. **On Building a Consulting Company:** [SOMETHING TELLS ME THIS MIGHT HOLD MORE PERSUASIVE POWER, BUT YOU USE THAT YOU THINK HOLDS THE MOST PERSUASIVE POWER]
    
    > "I dreamed of having a consulting company where it was spanned Across the Nation where we were able to serve and help people on this higher level and it's the reality of the life that I'm living right now."


for context, this time 'keira' the one who spoke in the podcast, it was a solo podcast, so we can refer to her directly

Based on these powerful quotes from Keira's solo episode, here's a personalized opening that captures the essence of her message:

"I just finished your episode about building meaningful businesses, and when you shared your journey of turning your nationwide consulting dream into reality, it really resonated with me. Your perspective on gratitude being the secret to fulfillment, coupled with your approach to viewing teams as invaluable assets, reflects the kind of leadership insights our industry needs. Thanks for sharing these authentic experiences."

Or a more focused version:

"Your recent episode on building strong teams particularly struck a chord with me. When you spoke about having 'ride or die' team members and how 'teamwork makes dreams become reality,' it highlighted what true leadership looks like. These are the kind of practical, experience-based insights that make your show so valuable."

Both versions:

Directly reference Keira's own words
Connect multiple themes naturally
Maintain authenticity without flattery
Show genuine engagement with the content
Would you like me to try other variations or focus on different aspects from her quotes?

Me

ok, let focus only on two points, of her dream that turned into reality and building strong teams

Here's a focused version using just those two key points from Keira's episode:

"I just finished your episode where you shared your journey of turning your nationwide consulting vision into reality. Your perspective on building strong teams - especially the importance of having those 'ride or die' team members you can truly count on - really hit home. Thanks for sharing these experiences."

Or another way:

"Your recent episode about transforming your consulting company dream into reality really resonated with me. I particularly connected with your thoughts on the power of having dependable team members who you can genuinely count on. Thanks for bringing these real-world insights to your show."

Both versions:

Focus on just the two main points
Use Keira's actual language ("ride or die")
Keep it personal yet professional
Avoid marketing fluff
Sound natural and conversational
Which version feels more authentic to you? We can refine it further if needed.

Me

it's good but make it sound more human like

Here's a more conversational, human-like version:

"You know, I was listening to your episode where you talked about your consulting company - how you dreamed of taking it nationwide and actually made it happen. And man, when you spoke about having those 'ride or die' team members who you can really count on, that just clicked with me. Thanks for putting these stories out there."

Or:

"Just finished listening to your episode, and I loved how you opened up about your consulting journey - from dreaming about going nationwide to actually living it now. Really connected with what you said about building your team, especially that part about having people you can truly count on. Thanks for sharing these experiences."

Now it:

Sounds like a real person talking
Uses natural transitions ("you know," "and man")
Keeps Keira's authentic language
Feels like the start of a genuine conversation
Avoids any corporate-speak
How's that feeling? More like how you'd actually talk to someone?

Me

it's better but can yoou go for something else other than 'thanks for sharing these experiences'

Ah yes, let's make that closing more natural:

"You know, I was listening to your episode where you talked about your consulting company - how you dreamed of taking it nationwide and actually made it happen. And man, when you spoke about having those 'ride or die' team members who you can really count on, that just clicked with me. It's exactly the kind of real talk we need more of."

Or:

"Just finished listening to your episode, and I loved how you opened up about your consulting journey - from dreaming about going nationwide to actually living it now. Really connected with what you said about building your team, especially that part about having people you can truly count on. These are the conversations that make a difference."

The new closings:

Feel more natural and less formulaic
Avoid the overused "thanks for sharing"
Still acknowledge value without being fluffy
Sound like something you'd actually say in conversation
Which closing feels more authentic to you?

Me


This was perfect, now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider these pointers, since they are pretty much the same  we can club them together and refer to them as one:

**Trial and Error in Business Innovation** ✅
    
    - _"Implement what you have trial and error and just improve it. Nothing will ever be perfect and I think that is the way to go."_

1. **Perseverance and Grit** ✅
    
    - _"You have to be patient with yourself and give yourself room to learn, not necessarily fail, but to learn and be imperfect."_
2. **Embracing Imperfection ** ✅
    
    - _"Nothing will ever be perfect and I think that is the way to go."_

    - _"I applied for a clinical educator job even though I didn't meet all the qualifications. I shot my shot and I was able to become part of the team."_


'''

use these templates which evrer feel relevant (feel free to make relevant tweaks to them):

- Your recent episode on [Episode Topic] – specifically the <mark style="background: #D22B2B;">segment</mark> on [Specific Point] – really resonated with me.
- I wanted to reach out after your latest episode on [Episode Topic]. The way you <mark style="background: #D22B2B;">unpacked</mark> [Specific Point] was incredibly nuanced and thought-provoking.

'''

only keep the writing style and tonality same, you leave off other only irrelevant instruction

Here's a natural, conversational opening that ties together these themes about embracing imperfection and continuous improvement:

"You know, I was listening to your episode about trial and error in business, and when your guest talked about giving yourself room to learn and be imperfect - man, that really hit home. Especially that part about how nothing will ever be perfect, but we just keep improving as we go. Even loved that real example they shared about applying for the clinical educator role despite not meeting all the qualifications. These are the kind of honest conversations that actually matter."

Or a slightly different angle:

"Just finished your episode about embracing imperfection in business growth, and I found myself nodding along when your guest spoke about the whole trial-and-error journey. Their point about being patient with yourself while continuously improving - rather than chasing perfection - really struck a chord. It's refreshing to hear such practical wisdom backed by real experiences."

Which approach feels more authentic to you? We can refine it further to match exactly the tone you're looking for.

Me

All right the thing is it is the intro section uh this is supposed to be the intro section it has become v2 uh big it has too many lines, shorten them very sightly and these variations are becoming too similar to the past variations like nothing has actually changed and I want you to change that while keeping it natural human like and conversational so for some time stop using phrases like a man that really hit home and try to change this line these are the kind of honest conversations that actually matter maybe rephrase it in a different way or just completely change the last line and even the second variation change this line “it's refreshing to hear such practical with some backed by real experiences" and again stop using for a while stop using phrases like really stuck a chord you can use something else something which has which has means the same but yeah it sounds too like exciting too forced and ok what I liked about the variations is the fact that you focused on the example that's really good that makes it really personal so that's really good even even this line that open code especially that part about how nothing will ever be perfect but we just keep improving as we go” these two things are really good and in the second version I don't like the use of the line ii found myself nodding along when your guest spoke it's fun it's like good but I don't think people speak like that in daily life that's how I want the personal our first intro to be to be like human like that's something like how naturally people speak yeah that would be it

Ah, I get it - let's make it shorter, more natural, and avoid those overused phrases. Here's a fresh take:

"I listened to your episode about business growth, and your guest's take on trial and error stuck with me - especially when they shared about landing that clinical educator role without ticking all the boxes. It's nice to hear someone talk straight about learning as you go."

Or:

"Your recent episode on business growth caught my interest, particularly when your guest talked about giving yourself space to learn and improve. That example about the clinical educator role? That's exactly the kind of real-world stuff I appreciate hearing about."

Now it's:

Shorter and punchier
Uses more everyday language
Avoids those cliché phrases
Keeps the personal example
Sounds like actual conversation
Has a natural, not-trying-too-hard closing
How's that feeling? More like natural speech?

Me

 now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time

4. **On the Purpose of Responses:** ✅
    
    > "Our responses are not for that person that gave you the review, the responses are for the next person who's going to read it."

1. **On Honesty and Transparency:** ✅
    
    > "We always want to be honest... if you did something wrong, admit it and say that you're going to improve and not do that again."


5. **On Proactive Management:** ✅
    
    > "We always respond to reviews to show to people reading it that you are attentive to these things and you're not the kind of business or dental practice that's just going to let these problems continue without addressing them at all."

1. **On Handling Extreme Negative Reviews:** ✅
    
    > "We've had a person say some really liable things about one of our clients in a review and in that case we got an attorney involved and the attorney actually reached out to that person and had them remove that review because what they were saying was outrageous and damaging."

'''

This time let me give you some more context about my client so this time his recent podcast episode was about negative reviews in dental practices and he was basically telling dental practitioners how to deal with it again keep in mind I'm not practicing I'm not doing any form of dental practice uh so don't say something technical or something that comes off as ok I am uh something that comes off as me being involved or having some form of dental practice

'''

youtube title: How Dental Practices Should Respond to Negative Google Reviews

Perfect, let me craft an opening that shows appreciation for the business management aspect while making it clear you're viewing it from a non-dental perspective:

"I watched your episode about handling Google reviews, and what you said about responses being for future readers rather than the original reviewer - that's such a smart business insight. Your point about transparency in addressing issues really translates across industries."

Or:

"Your video on managing online reviews caught my attention, especially when you explained how responses shape future customers' perceptions. It's interesting how you balanced professional accountability with protecting businesses from unfair criticism - that legal case example really drove the point home."

Both versions:

Focus on the business strategy aspects, not dental specifics
Position you as someone interested in business practices
Keep it conversational and natural
Avoid dental industry jargon
Show genuine engagement with the content
Don't imply any dental practice involvement
Which direction feels more suitable? We can refine it further to match your preferred tone.

Me

"Benjamin! really loved your episode on handling negative google reviews especially when you said about responding with keeping future readers in our mind - it really clicked!" - refine this

Here are refined versions, keeping it natural and enthusiastic but not over-the-top:

"Benjamin! Your episode on handling Google reviews was eye-opening - especially that insight about writing responses with future readers in mind. Makes so much sense."

Or even simpler:

"Benjamin! Your take on handling Google reviews got me thinking - particularly about how responses aren't really for the reviewer, but for everyone who reads them later. Smart stuff."

Both:

Keep the personal touch with his name
Sound like natural conversation
Avoid business jargon
Show genuine interest without being overly formal
Get straight to the point
Don't use overused phrases like "really loved"
Maintain authenticity
Which version feels more like how you'd naturally express this?

Me

'particularly about how responses aren't really for the reviewer, but for everyone who reads them later. Smart stuff.' love this part

but include my first part here, and keep it the same except it should make grammatical sense and by grammatically and tone-wise correct

"Benjamin! Really loved your episode on handling negative Google reviews, particularly about how responses aren't really for the reviewer, but for everyone who reads them later. Smart stuff."

The opening keeps your enthusiastic, personal tone while the grammar flows naturally. It:

Maintains your original energy
Keeps Benjamin's name for that personal touch
Flows smoothly into the part you liked
Sounds like a natural conversation
Stays grammatically correct
Ends with that casual, genuine appreciation
How's that feeling? We can tweak it further if needed!

I can't help but notice the untapped potential of your videos/I can't help but notice the amount of value your videos have. (tell me which one fits better?)

There's so much that could be done to help The Dental Flow Podcast grow and reach its ideal audience.

Better video work, episode trailers, click-worthy thumbnails, and short-form content – we cover it all.

 now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time

1. **On the Prevalence of Embezzlement in Dentistry:** ✅
    
    > "85% of dental practices get embezzled from 85% Nationwide so it's scary and it's happening."

4. **On Risk Management and Mitigation:** ✅
    
    > "It's important as a business owner to start thinking about like Risk Management, risk mitigation... having accountability measures."
    
5. **On Trust vs. Verification:** ✅
    
    > "We want to make sure we're trusting but verifying and do that for a couple of months... create clarity around what's going on."

youtube title: Preparing Against Embezzlement with Marissa Nicholson and Chris Hammelev of the Dental Practice

'''

So here I want you to focus on two points one is obviously the pointers that I've mentioned second is also tell them that I love how niche uh the podcast is and how specific the podcast is another another doubt I have associated with it is I'm not sure if it that's an impressive thing to say uh but somewhere down the somewhere in my head at the back of my mind I think that is so just assured me that I just want to you know let them know that I really love how niche and specific the podcast is there's something very very exciting about it you can freeze it differently freeze it in a better way

Here's a natural opening that combines appreciation for the niche content and the specific insights:

"Benjamin! Just watched your episode on embezzlement in dental practices, and that statistic about 85% of practices being affected nationwide - that stopped me in my tracks. Love how your podcast tackles these specific, crucial issues that most business shows wouldn't touch. Your guests' emphasis on 'trust but verify' really drives home why these conversations matter."

Or a slightly different angle:

"Benjamin! That episode on embezzlement prevention was an eye-opener - especially that shocking 85% statistic. It's refreshing to see a podcast dive deep into such specific, critical issues in the dental space. The way your guests broke down risk management and verification strategies shows exactly why this kind of focused content is so valuable."

Both versions:

Acknowledge the niche focus naturally
Show appreciation without sounding gimmicky
Reference specific content to prove engagement
Sound conversational and genuine
Compliment the specialized nature without making it seem like a weakness
Position the niche focus as a strength
Which approach feels more authentic to you? We can refine it further to hit exactly the right tone.

Me

feedback, hosts's name is Steve,

tighten this: Just watched the episode on embezzlement in dental practices and the fact that 85% of dental practices get embezzled is just crazy!

I really love how niche the podcast gets sometimes talking about specific and crucial issues that I haven't seen most business podcast let it be any niche even touch.

Here's the tightened version:

"Steve! Just watched your episode on embezzlement in dental practices - that 85% statistic is mind-blowing!

Love how your podcast tackles such specific, crucial issues that most business shows wouldn't even touch."

It's now:

Corrected the host's name
More concise
Maintains the natural, conversational tone
Keeps the genuine appreciation for the niche content
Shows real engagement with the content
Flows better
Sounds like actual speech
Would you like me to try other variations, or shall we move forward with this version?

Me

refine it: I love how niche the podcast gets at times talking about specific and crucial topics that most business podcasts, be it any niche, even touch. - check grammar and spelling

Here's the refined version with proper grammar and flow:

"I love how niche your podcast gets, diving into specific and crucial topics that most business podcasts, regardless of their niche, rarely even touch."

Or even more naturally:

"I love how your podcast gets so specific, tackling crucial topics that most business shows - no matter the niche - wouldn't even touch."

Both versions:

Fix the grammar issues
Flow more naturally
Maintain the genuine appreciation
Remove awkward phrasing ("be it any niche")
Keep the conversational tone
Express the same idea more clearly
Which version sounds more natural to you?

Added "your" to first line for better flow
Added "the" before podcast name
Fixed spelling of "Steven"

Removed unnecessary punctuation

How's this looking?

Me

now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time

5. **The Impact of Accountability on Personal Growth** ✅
    
    - _"Using checklists and having a coach has been transformative, helping to overcome personal challenges and enhance leadership effectiveness."_

5. **Simplicity and Consistency** ✅
    
    - _"Start with simple checklists and gradually build upon them, ensuring consistency in daily operations."_

3. **Continuous Improvement and Adaptation ** ✅
    
    - _"Regularly update and refine your checklists and frameworks to adapt to changing circumstances and improve efficiency."_

1. **Discipline Over Desire** ✅
    
    - _"Having the drive and focus isn't enough; we need the discipline to execute our plans consistently."_

1. **Importance of Structured Checklists for CEOs** ✅
    
    - _"We have to either do them or do all the extra work that comes from not doing them. It's much easier to work out a half an hour a day than to suddenly end up near a heart attack managing massive crises."_

'''

So here if you will notice that the podcast host or the podcast guys they're like bunch of guys and they're friends right and they have in this episode they have spoken a lot about checklists I want you to keep that as the sort of the second focus the main focus should be you know the fact that they have talked about discipline and let me check yeah discipline over desires uh like focus on those things other than the checklist but the focus should just be one choose which one it should be and the secondary focus should be oh yeah how you know how you guys have spoken about checklist and yeah keep make sure to uh keep the youtube title in mind and yeah

Let me help craft that opening, focusing primarily on the discipline aspect with checklists as a secondary point. But first - could you share the YouTube title of the episode? That would help me frame the opening in better context with how they presented the topic.

Also, since you mentioned it's a group of friends hosting, it would be helpful to know if we should address them collectively or if there's a primary host we should address.

For now, I'm thinking of an approach like:

"Guys! That episode about discipline really hit different - especially when you talked about how drive and focus mean nothing without consistent execution. Love how you broke it down with the practical checklist approach too."

But I can make this much more specific and natural once you share the episode title and hosting context. Would you mind providing those details?

Me

make it sound more natural please, this is too robotic, tune down the excitement, no need to refer to them as guys (we'll decide it later), add 'your recent episode'...I'd say just focus on the main point, leave the checklist for now

and why is it only one variation? you always gave 2

Ah yes, here are two more natural, toned-down variations:

"Your recent episode about discipline over desire caught my attention - particularly that point about how having drive isn't enough without consistent execution. Really puts things in perspective."

Or:

"Just finished your recent episode, and what you said about discipline being more crucial than motivation really stuck with me. It's such a simple truth, but one we often overlook."

Both:

Start with "your recent episode" as requested
Focus solely on the discipline aspect
Sound more conversational and less artificially excited
Keep it genuine and grounded
Avoid addressing them as "guys"
Use natural language someone would actually use
Which tone feels more aligned with what you're going for?

Me

I Don't wnat you to grovel but compliment with confidence

Ah, got it - here are two versions that show appreciation with confidence:

"Your recent episode nailed it with that distinction between discipline and desire. That point about consistent execution being more valuable than pure motivation - that's exactly what people need to hear."

Or:

"Your recent episode on discipline was spot-on. When you emphasized how drive alone isn't enough, and that consistent execution is what actually moves the needle - that's the kind of straight talk that makes your show valuable."

Both:

Show appreciation without groveling
Maintain professional confidence
Acknowledge value without being overly deferential
Keep it conversational but assured
Demonstrate understanding of the core message
Sound like a peer rather than a fan
Which strikes the right balance for you?

Me

"Just finished your recent episode, and what you guys said about ohow discipline is more important than drive and focus stuck with me. Really puts things into perspective.

It's clear to me that the quality of dialogue here is truly a standout.

My concern?

I see so much potential here – a lot that could be done to help [podcast name] find its target audience.

How's this looking?

Me

in the first line, do you think writing 'really' twice kinda makes it read awfyl

Ah yes, good catch! Let's fix that repetition. Here are two better versions:

"Just finished your recent episode, and what you said about discipline being more important than drive and focus resonated with me. Really puts things into perspective."

Or:

"Just finished your recent episode, and what you said about discipline being more important than drive and focus stuck with me. Makes you think differently about success."

Both versions:

Remove the repetitive "really"
Maintain the natural flow
Keep the meaningful observation
Sound more polished
Avoid awkward repetition
Still feel conversational
Which version do you prefer for the opening?

Me

'I see so much untapped potential here – a lot that could be done to help [podcast name] find its target audience.' - how about this line?

Here are better versions of that line:

"I see so much untapped potential here – ways we could help [podcast name] reach its ideal audience."

Or:

"There's significant untapped potential here – opportunities to help [podcast name] reach its ideal audience."

Both:

Remove the redundant "a lot that could be done"
Sound more confident and direct
Use stronger, cleaner phrasing
Keep the positive tone without being pushy
Replace "target audience" with "ideal audience" (sounds less marketing-heavy)
Are more concise while conveying the same message
Which version feels stronger to you?

Me


'I see much untapped potential here – a lot that could be done to help [podcast name] find its target audience.' - how about this line? grammatically correct?

Let's fix this line as there's still some awkwardness in the construction. The phrase "much untapped potential" followed by "a lot that could be done" creates redundancy. Here are grammatically correct and cleaner versions:

"I see much untapped potential here – ways to help [podcast name] find its target audience."

Or simply:

"I see untapped potential here – ways to help [podcast name] find its target audience."

The issue with your version is:

"much untapped potential" + "a lot that could be done" is redundant
The dash connects two phrases that don't parallel each other well
"A lot that could be done" is a wordy construction
Would you like to try other variations that maintain your intended meaning while being grammatically smoother?

Me

now let's start with our next email:

for the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

3. **Strategic Use of Social Media Platforms** ✅
    - _"Choose your purpose to choose your platform... LinkedIn is great for networking, Facebook for active groups, Instagram and TikTok for reaching patients."_
5. **Impact of Personal Branding on Practice Ownership** ✅
    - _"When you buy a practice, your existing personal brand can transfer to your practice brand, creating a sense of familiarity and trust."_
6. **Role of Content in Building Relationships** ✅
    - _"Personal branding helps build relationships with potential patients before they even become patients."_

'''

try to incorporate the opints about personal brand with podcasts, how podcsats helps you build personal brand, and reinforcing their own ideas

how podcast makes you look much more professional and builds trust, effective in showcasing your expertise.

iff these are too many points to include all at once, I'd ask you to give variations of each point or variations combining few points together

Here are different variations focusing on different aspects while keeping it natural and conversational:

Variation 1 (focusing on personal brand transfer): "Your recent episode on personal branding really clicked - especially when you talked about how an established personal brand transfers into practice ownership. It's exactly what your podcast demonstrates - building trust and familiarity before any direct interaction."

Variation 2 (focusing on platform strategy + podcasting): "Just finished your episode about strategic platform choices, and it got me thinking about how perfectly podcasting fits in. Like you said, each platform serves a purpose - and podcasts really showcase expertise in a way social posts just can't match."

Variation 3 (relationship building + trust): "Your latest episode about building relationships through content really resonated with me. When you talked about connecting with people before they become patients - that's exactly what your podcast achieves, creating that professional trust through meaningful conversations."

Each version:

Reinforces their own insights
Connects their points to podcasting naturally
Sounds conversational without being too casual
Avoids marketing-speak
Shows genuine engagement with their content
Would you like me to try other combinations of these points, or does one of these directions feel right?

Me

Andy, Dentology Podcast deserves more - how's this? it'll be the subject line

That's a strong subject line! It's:

Personal (using the host's name)
Shows respect for their work
Implies opportunity without being pushy
Short and direct
Creates curiosity
Avoids marketing clichés
Sounds like a genuine observation
You could also consider: "Andy, let's grow Dentology Podcast further"

But I actually prefer your version because:

"deserves more" feels more genuine
Suggests recognition of their current value
Implies potential without being salesy
Sounds more like a peer-to-peer conversation
Would you like to stick with "Andy, Dentology Podcast deserves more"?

Me

was it grammatically correct?

Let's check the grammar for "Andy, Dentology Podcast deserves more":

You have two options to make it grammatically correct:

"Andy, The Dentology Podcast deserves more" (Adding "The" because it's referring to a specific podcast)
"Andy, your Dentology Podcast deserves more" (Using "your" to show possession)
Both are grammatically correct, but I'd recommend "Andy, The Dentology Podcast deserves more" because:

It sounds more professional
It's technically correct
Still maintains the personal touch with "Andy"
Keeps the impact of "deserves more"
Which version do you prefer?

also the episode was mainly done with dentists and financing in context, I want to let them now that it helped me as well, even though I am not in dentitrsy, some of the points were really good.

Youtube Title: Are You Ready? How to Build a Legacy to Die For feat. Kimberly Harms, D.D.S

Host: CIndy
Podcast Name: Dental Alements
Context: You're choosing it this time, what ever fits best and whatever you've learnt as in - what kind of emails I like
Medium: it's a video porcast

Based on your previous preferences and the content, I'd focus on the legacy/teaching aspect combined with emotional storytelling, as this would make a great case for video content. Here's my draft:

"Cindy! Your recent episode with Dr. Kimberly Harms was powerful - especially when she talked about how the best legacy is teaching the next generation. That kind of wisdom needs to be seen, not just heard.

It's clear that Dental Alements delivers content that matters beyond just dentistry.

Here's what I noticed...

There's untapped potential here - particularly in maximizing the impact of these meaningful conversations.

Better video production, compelling episode intros, scroll-stopping thumbnails, and short-form content – we take care of everything.

Here's what this means in action:

We turn these powerful stories into engaging short-form clips for YouTube and Instagram
Our episode intros capture the emotional depth of conversations like Dr. Harms' (higher AVD)
We create thumbnails that convey the weight of these discussions (higher CTR)
Here's what the numbers look like:

Stevan Kospetin: Gained 28K+ subscribers in 3 weeks (now at 107K)
Yogire: Generated 11K+ followers and 7M+ views in 3 months (reels recognized by celebrities)
MO Syed (KSI and Sidemen): Built from 0 to 43.5K followers in 5 months
Just reply 'interested' for more info! Thanks.

P.S. Stories like Dr. Harms' deserve to be shared widely - seeing her expressions and emotions would add another layer of impact to these important messages."

I chose this angle because:

Focuses on the emotional, teaching aspect which works well for video
Shows understanding of the content's deeper value
Makes a natural case for visual content
Maintains your preferred conversational tone
Avoids multiple points and stays focused
Connects naturally to our services
Would you like me to try a different angle or refine this version?

Me

can you draft a subject line, one that's simpler. 

Here are some simple, impactful subject line options:

"Cindy, let's amplify Dental Alements' impact"
"Cindy, Dental Alements deserves wider reach"
"Cindy, these stories need to be seen"
The first two follow your previous style (name + podcast + potential), while the third connects to the episode's emotional content.

I personally recommend: "Cindy, Dental Alements deserves wider reach" because it:

Uses her name (personal touch)
Mentions podcast name (specific)
Implies opportunity without being pushy
Short and direct
Grammatically correct
Sounds like a genuine observation
Would you like to try other variations or does one of these work?

Me

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

On Creating a Safe and Open Work Environment: ✅

"I did a one-on-one with somebody from the front desk for the first time... this is a safe place anything you tell me I will not tell anybody else."

On Transitioning to Leadership and Delegation: ✅

"When I first got started in business I said things like this my team sucks they don't get it... I created this like bottleneck where I became the bottleneck of the company."

On Providing Autonomy and Utilizing Team Strengths: ✅

"The things that you don't like doing there's people on your team that would love to do it and take more responsibility."

On Building Relationships Through One-on-Ones: ✅

"You need to know their kids' names you need to know who their husbands or spouses are."

On Creating a Productive Work Environment: ✅

"If you don't delegate these things to people you're just going to get so overwhelmed with everything you're going to have a pile of things to do not enough time to do it and everything you're going to do is going to be in a hurry."

On Psychological Safety in the Workplace: ✅

"It's called psychological safety... anyone that contributes to the team... you don't hurt that person you don't get critical you don't point fingers and blame you don't get defensive."

'''

yt title: Ultimate Guide to Automate Your Dental Practice

'''

the first 'angle' that came in my mind: is to say how I found it useful even thouguh I am not in dentistry

do you have any other more persuasive angle in mind?

Yes! While the non-dentistry angle could work, I see a more compelling angle here - connecting their message about delegation and team empowerment to what we offer. Here's my thinking:

"Your recent episode on practice automation really resonated - particularly when you talked about breaking free from being the bottleneck by delegating to team members who'd love to take on more responsibility.

Speaking of delegation... [this transitions perfectly to our pitch about taking content creation off their plate]"

Or we could focus on the psychological safety angle:

"Your recent episode on creating psychological safety in practices caught my attention - especially that point about how one-on-one connections build trust and openness. It's exactly what comes through in your content.

But I noticed something..."

The delegation angle works better because:

It directly mirrors what we're offering (taking tasks off their plate)
Uses their own philosophy to make our case
Shows we understand their pain point (being overwhelmed)
Makes a natural transition to our services
More persuasive than just saying "I found it useful"
Would you like me to draft the full email using either of these angles?

Me

this is amazing!!! the first angle is perfect! 

although thge phrasing is too detailed.

Rather than namning the episode like this "practice automation really resonated" - just simply use 'Dental automation' - if it makes sense from the youtube title

Your recent episode on Dental automation was 'increadibly thoguh provoking' (may be try to figure out one word to replace this) - espeically when you and Dr. Paul talked about [bring in the delegation - overwhelm pointer] 

Ah yes, let's make it cleaner and more direct! Here's the refined opening:

"Your recent episode on dental automation was eye-opening - especially when you talked about breaking free from being the company bottleneck by delegating to team members who actually want more responsibility."

Or even more conversationally:

"Your recent episode on dental automation clicked with me - particularly that point about how we often become our own bottleneck by not delegating to team members who'd welcome the extra responsibility."

I avoided:

"incredibly thought-provoking" (too wordy)
Unnecessary details
Over-explanation
Used:

"eye-opening" or "clicked" (simple, direct)
Clean connection to the delegation point
Natural flow
Would you like me to draft the full email using this streamlined opening?

Me

avoid using the word bottleneck - too speciifc, use the word overwhelm apptly...then use this 'delegating to team members who actually want more responsibility."' or this 'how we often become our own bottleneck by not delegating to team members who'd welcome the extra responsibility.'

phrase it simpley like 'how we overwhlem ourselves by not delegating to already eager and competent team memebers (may be use a better word than eager or reaphrase it ocmpletely but I think you get the point)

Ah yes, much better! Here's the refined opening:

"Your recent episode on dental automation clicked with me - particularly that point about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to team members who are ready and willing to take on more."

Or:

"Your recent episode on dental automation was eye-opening - especially when you discussed how we create our own overwhelm by not delegating to capable team members who'd welcome more responsibility."

Both versions:

Avoid "bottleneck"
Use "overwhelm" more naturally
Sound more conversational
Keep the core message
Flow better
Avoid awkward phrases like "eager" or "competent"
Which version feels more natural to you? We can refine it further or move on to drafting the full email with your preferred opening.

Me

I want it to be shortened and sound more simple:

Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked! - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people willing to take on more. - something like this

Perfect! Here's the clean, simple version:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially that point about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to team members eager to do more."

Or even simpler:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people ready to take on more."

Both are:

Short and punchy
Conversational
Natural flow
Get straight to the point
Avoid unnecessary words
The second version feels slightly more natural and casual. Which one do you prefer? We can then build the rest of the email around your chosen opening.

Me

ready/willing which words puts in a position of power relatively? which less 'BETA' iykwim

Ah, good thinking about the power dynamics!

"Willing" sounds more like they're doing you a favor or are submissive, while "ready" implies competence and capability - it puts them in a more equal position.

So let's go with:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people ready to take on more."

"Ready" implies:

Competence
Capability
Equal footing
Professional preparedness
Natural next step
Versus "willing" which can sound:

Submissive
Like they're doing a favor
Less confident
More passive
Would you like me to draft the full email using this more empowered phrasing?

Me

go to the transition now

Here's how we can transition from that opening to our pitch:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people ready to take on more.

Speaking of delegation...

There's untapped potential here - particularly in expanding your podcast's reach while taking content creation off your plate."

Or a slightly different angle:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people ready to take on more.

This got me thinking about your podcast...

There's so much room to help [Podcast Name] grow and reach its ideal audience, without adding to your workload."

Both transitions:

Use their own message about delegation to introduce our services
Make a natural connection
Keep it conversational
Lead smoothly into our value proposition
Avoid being pushy
Which transition feels stronger to you? We can then complete the full email.

Me

the second one is perfect! it feels like you're finally understanding me

Yes! I'm getting a much better feel for your style - natural, conversational, but still professional and strategic. You prefer:

Clean, simple language
Subtle but smart connections
Power-conscious word choices
Natural flow over marketing speak
Strategic messaging that doesn't feel forced
Should we continue with the full email using this opening and transition:

"Your recent episode on dental automation really clicked - especially about how we overwhelm ourselves by not delegating to people ready to take on more.

This got me thinking about your podcast...

There's so much room to help [Podcast Name] grow and reach its ideal audience, without adding to your workload."

Would you like me to draft the rest maintaining this same tone and approach?

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 


1. **On a Consultant's Experience:**
    
    > "One of the examples I personally used was a consultant that went into a practice in Canada and that dentist said I really value you know clinical excellence and training she looked at the profit and loss and there was not one cent spent on training I'm I'm a classic I really value exercise then I look at my calendar my diary and I haven't allocated any time in my week for exercise be as basic as that."

3. **On Honesty in Practice:**
    
    > "At a practice I was at with regard to honesty there was not a great outcome for a patient what are we going to say to that patient was the owner was like well we'll have to tell the truth one of our our core values is honesty he rang out the patient and said look we we want this get checked out by the general dentist we're concerned about it we spoken to the general dentist or Custer cover um it ended up to be all fine they went to the dentist and she ended up to be a raving fan that was actually a really nice thing for the the uh team members to see that one of those values was honesty you wanted to have that honest environment."

1. **On Recruitment:** ✅
    
    > "For the recruitment process because you want to make sure that the people that you're attracting are the ones that are aligned with the company values and are actually going to work in that Dynamic that you already have."
    
2. **On Defining Values:** ✅
    
    > "I would always ask a business leader a practice you know manager right up front what are your organization's core values if they weren't able to articulate that really clearly and then show me how it's demonstrated in the operations of the practice then I would want to go right back to the start and perhaps develop that you know from the beginning."

 **On Measuring Values:** ✅
    
    > "Another aspect that I find is often missed a lot of people a lot of companies have great core values and they're on the website or they're on a lovely poster on the wall and they get talked about a lot if the experience of those values isn't isn't demonstrated they need to be measured you need to be able to measure that those values are actually being demonstrated and being experienced."

    > "Our values are neither good nor bad they serve a purpose or they don't serve a purpose and we can raise and lower them as we need to."

podcast name: beyond chairside
podcast description: "In this episode of "Dental Success: Beyond Chairside," we’re tackling the challenge of building a cohesive workplace culture. Is your team dictating how they want to work based on their past experiences? Are you finding it difficult to foster a positive environment that aligns with your practice’s values?

Today, I’m joined by Veronica Smith, Founder of EPICC Solutions. Veronica’s passion for creating strong and positive workplace cultures shines through as she shares her insights on the critical role values play in shaping successful dental practices. She believes that values are the foundation of any thriving business, and in this episode, she provides actionable strategies for aligning your team with these values to inspire their best work."
'''


the first 'angle' that came in my mind: is to say how they're talking about such niche topics that are onot usually discossed in dentitry...

do you have any other more persuasive angle in mind?

Yes! I see a more compelling angle here - focusing on the demonstration/measurement of values, which ties perfectly into visual content. Here's my thinking:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture really clicked - especially that point about how values need to be demonstrated, not just written on a wall. It's one thing to talk about values, another to show them in action."

This angle works better because:

It naturally transitions into video content (showing vs telling)
Connects to their message about measuring and demonstrating values
Makes a case for visual content without being pushy
Sets up our pitch about helping them demonstrate their expertise visually
More strategic than just noting the niche topic
Alternative opening:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture caught my attention - particularly when you discussed how values need to be measured and demonstrated, not just displayed on a wall."

Both lead naturally into: "This got me thinking about your podcast..."

The demonstration/measurement angle is more persuasive because:

Uses their own philosophy to make our case
Shows understanding of their core message
Creates a natural bridge to visual content
More compelling than just noting the uniqueness of the topic
Would you like me to draft the full email using this angle?

Me

yes please, becaus e I am not getting it

Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls. [so we're removing the last line form ehre rather say something like, I deeply resonate with that...or something along those lines]

Ah yes! Here's the refined opening section:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls. Really resonated with that perspective.

It's clear to me that Beyond Chairside goes deeper than most dental content out there.

It's clear that Beyond Chairside delivers substance that stands out in the dental space.

This got me thinking...

Your episodes are getting 20-30 views right now, but content this valuable deserves much wider reach. I can easily see these numbers multiplying with the right approach."

Which direction feels stronger? We can refine the phrasing further to hit exactly the right tone you're looking for.

How's this looking?

Me

do you think we can tighten this even more? "Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls. That kind of depth really hits home.


It's clear to me that Beyond Chairside goes deeper than most dental content out there."

something like: "Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls.


Which makes it clear to me that Beyond Chairside goes deeper than most dental content out there."

Yes! That's much tighter and flows better. Here's another way to make it even more concise:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls. It's this depth that makes Beyond Chairside stand out from typical dental content."

Or:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls. This kind of substance shows why Beyond Chairside stands apart in the dental space."

Both versions:

Connect the ideas more smoothly
Remove redundant phrasing
Keep the compliment while being more direct
Sound more natural
Use fewer words to say the same thing
Which version feels stronger to you?

Me

no, let's go with mine but fix it for grammar and spelling, your one currently again sounds like unwarranted flattery

You're right - yours maintains the genuine observation without overdoing it. Here's your version with grammar cleaned up:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls.

Which makes it clear that Beyond Chairside goes deeper than most dental content out there."

Small fixes:

Removed "to me" (cleaner)
Added proper spacing
Fixed connection between sentences
This version:

Stays authentic
Avoids unnecessary flattery
Makes a simple observation
Maintains your natural tone
Would you like to continue with this opening for the rest of the email?

Me

what if we add 'to me'?

Yes, "to me" actually makes it more personal and genuine! Here's how it reads:

"Your recent episode on workplace culture was refreshing - diving into how values need to be lived, not just displayed on walls.

Which makes it clear to me that Beyond Chairside goes deeper than most dental content out there."

This works better because:

"to me" makes it a personal observation rather than a blanket statement
Sounds more conversational
Feels like genuine feedback rather than marketing speak
Shows it's your authentic perspective
Still avoids unwarranted flattery
Shall we use this version and continue with the rest of the email?

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

3. **On Realizing the Gaps in Conventional Healthcare:** ✅
    
    > "There's almost like a gaping hole of interest in specializing in that realm and so it was just kind of like a combination of already having some interest and trying to find my way in Portland where there's a lot of naturopathic doctors and and separate out to some degree."

1. **On Taking a Proactive Approach:** ✅
    
    > "You have to take a proactive approach and dig essentially which to me means looking at your family history looking at your lifestyle looking at your your lab testing and potentially depending on your age and things like that some type of Imaging study to really know because you're otherwise totally guessing."

2. **On the Connection Between Oral Health and Cardiovascular Disease:** ✅
    
    > "There's a clear connection between General oral health and especially like preventive care and the risk for cardiovascular disease."
    
3. **On Nutrition's Role in Cardiovascular Health:** ✅
    
    > "Nutrition is the only thing I know of that gets at all of those angles from one technical standpoint because doing the right things with your diet and potentially some supplements and things like that will essentially help get some of the wood out of the way keep the matches from being lit not pour any gasoline on there and you can pour some water in there with certain types of nutrients and things like that."
    
4. **On Whole Health and Human Evolution:** ✅
    
    > "Our declining Health as a species is directly correlated to our Detachment from nature... literally the average person these days lives a life that is not in any way connected to how humans have evolved to in the environment and way that they've evolved to live."

- yt desc.: The Whole Health Podcast: Episode 3 with Dr. Daniel Chong
In this episode, Dr. Kelly Blodgett DMD, NMD, IBDM and Megan Barnett MS, CNS sit down with Dr. Daniel Chong, a cardiovascular specialist at BioLounge, to explore transformative approaches to cardiovascular health. Frustrated by conventional medicine's inability to address the root causes of the most prevalent health crisis in the U.S., Dr. Chong has developed a niche practice focused on prevention, treatment, and even reversal of cardiovascular disease.
As a self-described "cardiovascular health facilitator," Dr. Chong uses cutting-edge screening tools, evidence-based therapies, and in-depth patient education to help his patients achieve optimal health outcomes. Tune in for an eye-opening discussion on proactive cardiovascular care and the innovative techniques redefining heart health.

'''

the first 'angle' that came in my mind: is to say how they're talking about road topics - and maybe acknoledging  that? we can do something?

do you have any other more persuasive angle in mind?

Yes! I see a more compelling angle here - focusing on how they're bridging complex connections (between nature, dental care, nutrition, and heart health) in an accessible way. Here's my thinking:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Chong was fascinating - especially how you connected our detachment from nature to declining health. The way you broke down these complex relationships into digestible insights really works.

Which makes it clear to me that The Whole Health Podcast excels at making these crucial connections accessible."

This angle works better because:

Acknowledges their skill at explaining complex topics
Naturally leads into how visual content could enhance this further
More specific than just "broad topics"
Sets up our pitch about helping visualize these connections
Can transition into how video content could help viewers better grasp these interconnected concepts
Alternative opening:

"Your recent episode on cardiovascular health was eye-opening - particularly how you illustrated the connections between oral health, nutrition, and heart disease. Making these complex relationships clear isn't easy."

The connections angle is more persuasive because:

Shows understanding of their unique approach
Recognizes their skill at explanation
Creates natural bridge to visual content
More specific and meaningful than just noting broad scope
Would you like me to draft the full email using either of these angles?

Me

my idea: Your last episode with Dr. Chong was amazing! - to hear the connection between our health and nature was very refreshing and served as a reminder to stay in touch with nature.

(now, we go about something along the lines of...)

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

(and then we start with something like: 'my concern?')

Yes! That's much more natural and genuine. Here's how I'd refine it:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Chong was amazing - hearing about the connection between our health and nature was refreshing and a much-needed reminder.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

There's so much room to help The Whole Health Podcast reach more people who need to hear these important insights.

[continue with our standard pitch...]"

This works better because:

Sounds more conversational
Shows genuine engagement with the content
Avoids trying too hard to sound smart
Makes a natural connection to reach
Sets up our pitch organically
Maintains authenticity

let's change this 'There's so much room to help The Whole Health Podcast reach more people who need to hear these important insights.' to something like: there's so muhc room to help [podcast name] to expand and reach it's ideal audience who are craving for content like this'

Ah yes, much better! Here's the refined opening:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Chong was amazing - hearing about the connection between our health and nature was refreshing and a much-needed reminder.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

Changes made:

Fixed "it's" to "its"
Used your suggested phrasing which sounds:
More focused (ideal audience vs. generic "more people")
More dynamic ("expand and reach" vs. just "reach")
More compelling ("craving for content" shows demand)
Less preachy (removes "need to hear these important insights")
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this improved opening?

Me

how abt this? :- Your recent episode with Dr. Chong was amazing - hearing about the connection between our health and nature was refreshing (and a much-needed reminder!)

Yes, that's even better! The exclamation in parentheses adds a nice personal touch and feels more natural. Here's how it flows:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Chong was amazing - hearing about the connection between our health and nature was refreshing (and a much-needed reminder!)

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

"Better video work, episode trailers, compelling thumbnails, and short-form content – we take care of it all."

I am thinking of adding linkedIN content here, how do I do that? you can replace thumbnails.

so the idea is I will repurpose those shorts or some content of the podcast to linkedin

and in our standard pitch from now on, we can add 'linkedin' along with isntagram and tiktok

Ah yes! Here's the refined version:

"Better video work, episode trailers, LinkedIn content, and short-form clips – we take care of it all."

And then in the breakdown section: "- Turning your podcast episodes into strategic content for YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram

Creating episode intros that keep viewers watching longer (higher AVD)
Crafting content that resonates across platforms (higher engagement)"
This works because:

Adds LinkedIn without making the line too long
Replaces "thumbnails" which can be covered under "video work"
Acknowledges LinkedIn as a professional platform
Makes sense for their health/medical content
Expands reach to professional networks
Would you like me to draft the full email with this LinkedIn-inclusive version?

Me

"Whether you're in real estate, medicine, or spirituality, we help your podcast grow to attract quality leads and establish you as a market leader in your niche."

from here, remove the niches.

I want to say something along the lines of

We're a content repurposing agency that helps pordcast grow [then you add one line - given what ever you've learnt in this convo] and then at the end add: establish you as a market leader in your niche.

Here's the refined version:

"We're a content repurposing agency that helps podcasts grow by turning meaningful conversations into engaging visual content, establishing you as a market leader in your niche."

Or even simpler:

"We're a content repurposing agency that helps podcasts reach their ideal audience through strategic visual content, establishing you as a market leader in your niche."

Both versions:

Remove specific niches
Focus on value proposition
Keep it concise
Maintain professional tone
End with the strong "market leader" point
Connect to our earlier themes about reaching the right audience
Which version feels more aligned with your vision?

perfect! thank you so much!

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

2. **Importance of Star Power and Creativity in Social Media** ✅
    - _"To really be successful at today's social media you have to have star power... you have to be good on camera, you have to be creative, you have to know how to edit or you have to outsource those things."_

6. **Doctor Time Marketing Concept** ✅
    - _"Doctor time marketing is what you want and social media is very very very expensive when it comes to time if you're going to do it well."_

1. **Strategic Use of Social Media** ✅
    
    - Focus on authentic content that reflects your personality and interests.
    - Allocate only a small portion (e.g., 10%) of your social media content to orthodontics to maintain engagement.
    - Avoid jumping on every social media trend; instead, use platforms that align with your strengths and interests.

3. **Efficient Use of Time and Resources** ✅ (focus on the delegate tasks point)
    
    - Prioritize marketing activities that offer the highest return on investment, such as SEO and Google Ads.
    - Delegate tasks that are outside your expertise or comfort zone to dedicated team members or professionals.
    - Implement systematic and consistent marketing processes to maintain steady growth.

5. **Avoid Common Pitfalls** ✅ (use it only if you can use it persuasively, or else avoid it)
    
    - Do not rely solely on social media for practice growth.
    - Be wary of low-cost SEO services that do not deliver substantial results.
    - Avoid the sunk cost fallacy by discontinuing ineffective marketing strategies promptly.

2. **Challenges with Initial Marketing Efforts** ✅
    
    - Faced with zero patients initially, Dr. Fagala leveraged social media to build his practice.
    - Highlighted the trial-and-error nature of early marketing attempts and the importance of adapting strategies.

'''

- yt desc.: Think about how people find services today. They search online, read reviews, and often make decisions before they even call your office. In fact, 93% of consumers say online reviews impact their purchasing decisions. Having a solid digital marketing strategy isn’t optional for an orthodontic practice—it’s essential.

Whether you’re a new orthodontist or an experienced practitioner looking to stay ahead, being visible online and building trust through digital marketing can make or break your growth.

In this episode, Dr. Kyle Fagala joins me to talk about the different ways we can leverage digital marketing to attract more patients and strengthen our practice.

Dr. Fagala, founder of Neon Canvas, walks us through how to build a standout online presence, leverage Google reviews, and create a sustainable growth system with SEO and Google Ads.

He also sheds light on his unique concept, "Doctor Time Marketing," and explains why your time is your most valuable resource.

'''

I think the angle is obvious this time, which is using his poitners about social media and outsourcing to pitch our services

Yes! Perfect angle - we can use his own points about doctor's time, star power requirements, and outsourcing to make our case. Here's my suggested opening:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Fagala really clicked - especially when he talked about how social media success requires star power, creativity, and strong editing skills... or outsourcing to the right people.

That point about 'doctor time marketing' being expensive when it comes to social media? Spot on.

This got me thinking about your podcast...

There's so much room to help [Podcast Name] expand and reach its ideal audience, without taking up your valuable time."

This works because it:

Uses his own points about outsourcing expertise
Acknowledges the time-cost reality
Makes a natural transition to our services
Shows we understand the value of their time
Sets up our pitch perfectly
Would you like me to draft the full email using this angle? We can then adjust the standard pitch to emphasize how we take care of the time-consuming aspects of content creation.

Me

ok this is perfect! before I start, what's doctor time amrketing?

"Doctor time marketing" refers to how valuable a doctor's (or medical professional's) time is, and how it should be spent wisely. The concept suggests that doctors should focus their time on patient care and their core expertise rather than spending it on marketing activities like social media content creation, which can be very time-consuming if done well.

In Dr. Fagala's context, he's emphasizing that:

A doctor's time is extremely valuable
Social media marketing is very time-intensive if done properly
It's often more efficient to outsource these tasks to specialists
Time spent on marketing is time taken away from patient care
This concept actually strengthens our pitch because:

We're offering to handle the time-consuming aspects of content creation
We're allowing them to focus on their core expertise (creating podcast content)
We're addressing the "time is money" aspect of marketing
We're positioning ourselves as the solution to the time-cost problem
Would you like me to refine the email opening with this understanding?

Me

ok, now the dude I am DMing he is the podcast host and not a dr. so we can remove that line

Ah yes, good catch! Let's refine it to be more relevant to a podcast host:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Fagala really clicked - especially when he talked about how social media success requires star power, creativity, and strong editing skills... or outsourcing to the right people.

This got me thinking about your podcast...

There's so much room to help [Podcast Name] expand and reach its ideal audience, without taking up your valuable time."

This version:

Removes the doctor-specific reference
Keeps the valuable insight about outsourcing
Maintains focus on the time-saving aspect
Still uses Dr. Fagala's expertise to make our point
Stays relevant to the podcast host's situation

Maintains the outsourcing angle
Stays relevant to our services
Sets up our pitch naturally
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this refined opening?

can you use a better phrasing than 'especially when he talked about'...it's becoming too repetitive

Yes! Here are some fresher ways to phrase it:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Fagala really clicked - particularly his insight about how social media success requires creative content, strong editing skills... or outsourcing to the right people."

Or:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Fagala really clicked - I resonated with his point about how social media success comes down to creative content, strong editing skills... or outsourcing to the right people."

Or even simpler:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Fagala really clicked - that point about social media success requiring creative content, strong editing skills... or outsourcing to the right people."

All versions:

Avoid the overused "especially when he talked about"
Sound more natural
Keep the core message
Flow better into our pitch
Which version feels more fresh to you?

Me

here: Better video production, custom episode intros, engaging thumbnails, and short-form content – we handle the complete package.

rather than thumbnails point, can yu add that we repurpose video content into linkedin post exclussively- and something along the lines of like that's exclusive only to linkedin

Yes! Here's how we could phrase it:

"Better video production, custom episode intros, LinkedIn-exclusive content, and short-form clips – we handle the complete package."

Or more specifically:

"Better video production, custom episode intros, professionally repurposed LinkedIn content, and short-form clips – we handle the complete package."

The LinkedIn content would then be detailed in the breakdown section like:

Turning your podcast episodes into strategic content for YouTube and Instagram
Creating LinkedIn-exclusive posts that position you as a thought leader
Crafting episode intros that keep viewers watching longer (higher AVD)
This emphasizes:

LinkedIn as a premium, professional platform
Exclusive content rather than just reposts
Professional positioning
Differentiated content strategy
Which version do you prefer?

Me

this is what I mam going with:

Better video production, episode intros, videos repurposed into LinkedIn-exclusive content, and short-form content – we handle the complete package.

accordinly can you make changes in the third point here:

Here's what this means in action:
    - We take your podcast and turn it into short-form clips for YouTube and Instagram with engaging animations
    - Our episode intros and trailers are designed for maximum watch time (higher AVD)
    - We create thumbnails and titles that people actually want to click (higher CTR)

Yes! Here's the updated breakdown:

Here's what this means in action:

We take your podcast and turn it into short-form clips for YouTube and Instagram with engaging animations
Our episode intros and trailers are designed for maximum watch time (higher AVD)
We repurpose your content into LinkedIn-exclusive posts that establish thought leadership (higher engagement)
The new third point:

Replaces thumbnails/titles with LinkedIn focus
Emphasizes exclusivity
Adds value proposition (thought leadership)
Uses engagement as metric instead of CTR
Maintains professional tone
Aligns with the opening package description
How's this looking?

Me

that was perfect!

yt desc.: In this engaging episode, Dr. David Houston, CEO of Australia Dental Group, sits down with Dr. Harry Goodman for an inspiring conversation that explores Dr. Goodman’s journey to becoming a skilled and compassionate dentist. Starting from his early years, Dr. Goodman shares personal insights into what fueled his passion for dentistry and led him to pursue his degree at James Cook University.

Together, they delve into the ins and outs of dental practice, touching on the challenges and triumphs that come with the profession. Dr. Goodman also shares his excitement about the recent scholarship awarded to him by Australia Dental Group to complete his Postgraduate Diploma in Implantology, an advanced step in his professional journey.

Dr. Houston offers his perspective on the four pillars he believes are essential for building a foundation as an elite dentist. He discusses the qualities and values that have shaped his own career and highlights the importance of continuous learning, patient care, technical skills, and ethical practice.

Whether you're a dental professional, a student, or someone interested in the dynamic world of dentistry, this episode offers valuable insights into the path to excellence in the field.

Looking at all these pointers, I see two strong angles we could take:

The Learning/Development Angle: "Your recent episode with Dr. Goodman really clicked - especially that insight about how the smallest details can change massive outcomes, whether in farming or dentistry. It's this kind of nuanced perspective that makes your content stand out."
The Mentorship/Teaching Angle: "Your recent episode with Dr. Goodman was refreshing - particularly when you discussed how having experienced mentors helps avoid common pitfalls. That kind of wisdom-sharing is exactly what the industry needs."
I recommend going with the first angle because:

It acknowledges their attention to detail
Shows appreciation for nuanced content
Naturally transitions to how we can help capture these details visually
Sets up our pitch about professional content creation

yt title: 4 Keys to Orthodontic Innovation


When Does Innovation Create More Problems than It Solves?
As the moat around the one-size-fits-all treatment approach evaporates, it’s more important than ever to be an expert in many treatment modalities to serve just one patient.

On this episode of the Smile Doctors Off Mute Podcast, self-proclaimed "ortho geek" Dr. Jep Paschal talks with Dr. Scott Law about his background in prosthodontics and the “new normal” of practicing orthodontics today:  • How to cultivate a culture of innovation within your team• Why it works to let people do what they’re good at• How the world’s most expensive doorstop gave way to a priceless lesson• The 4 criteria he uses to evaluate new innovations• and more  For any forward-thinking individuals looking to inspire a culture of innovation in your sphere of influence, this episode of the Smile Doctors Off Mute Podcast is a can’t-miss.
HIGHLIGHTS:

Dr. Paschal's Circuitous Journey Into Orthodontics (00:01:12)
Transitioning from Prosthodontics to Orthodontics (00:04:20)
Aesthetic and Cosmetic Correction Philosophies (00:07:25)

The Power of Delegation (00:31:57)
The Future Landscape of Orthodontics (00:41:09)
How the Specialty Will Survive (00:49:25)

Looking at these pointers, I see a compelling angle around innovation and empowering teams. Here's my suggested opening:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Paschal really clicked - especially when he talked about giving teams permission to fail being the cornerstone of implementing innovation. That's the kind of honest insight that makes your content valuable.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

There's so much room to help the Smile Doctors Off Mute Podcast expand and reach its ideal audience who value these authentic discussions."

This angle works because:

Uses one of their strongest insights about empowerment
Shows appreciation for authentic content
Naturally transitions to our services (we can help them innovate their content delivery)
Connects to their focus on moving forward and embracing change
Positions us as part of their innovation journey
Would you like me to draft the full email using this angle? We can emphasize how we help them innovate their content delivery while letting them focus on creating these valuable conversations.

Me

alright, this is good, but here's the issue, you're making the first line way too detailed...it's like a complex setence, make your sentences simple, conversational

I am brainstorming here, but let's say something like: Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail, as the key to innovation - really clicked.

Yes! That's much better - shorter, clearer, and more conversational. Here's the full opening:

"Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail, as the key to innovation - really clicked.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

There's so much room to help the Smile Doctors Off Mute Podcast expand and reach its ideal audience who value these authentic discussions."

This works better because:

Breaks down complex ideas into digestible pieces
Sounds like natural speech
Gets straight to the point
Maintains the powerful insight
Flows more smoothly
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this more conversational opening?

Me

yeah, lol don't use exactly what I gave you, give me some variations

Ah yes! Here are some conversational variations:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Paschal was eye-opening - especially that point about letting teams fail being the key to innovation."

Or:

"Really enjoyed your episode with Dr. Paschal - particularly his take on how giving teams freedom to fail drives innovation."

Or even simpler:

"Your recent episode with Dr. Paschal really clicked - that insight about empowering teams through the freedom to fail was spot-on."

All versions:

Keep it simple and conversational
Capture the key insight
Sound natural
Avoid complex sentences
Maintain the powerful message
Feel like something you'd actually say
Which tone feels more natural to you? We can refine further or move forward with your preferred version.

Me

Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail, as the key to innovation - really clicked

Really enjoyed your episode with Dr. Paschal - particularly his take on how giving teams freedom to fail drives innovation.

''''

I like these two, which one's better?

The first one is better:

"Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail, as the key to innovation - really clicked."

Because:

"Loved" is more direct and personal than "Really enjoyed"
Shorter, punchier phrases
"Really clicked" is a stronger ending than "drives innovation"
Feels more like natural conversation
The pause created by the period and dash adds nice rhythm
Here's the full email with this opening:

"Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail, as the key to innovation - really clicked.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

There's so much room to help the Smile Doctors Off Mute Podcast expand and reach its ideal audience who value these authentic discussions.

Would you like me to continue with the full email?

Me

'Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail being the key to innovation - really clicked.' - how abt this?

Yes, that's even better!

"Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail being the key to innovation - really clicked."

This version is best because:

Removes the awkward comma after "fail"
"being" flows more naturally than "as"
Maintains all the strengths of the original
Reads exactly like how someone would say it
Perfect balance of personal and professional
Want me to draft the full email with this refined opening?

Me

host's name is: Dr. scott
should I use dr. scott or dr. law
Dr. Scott, Smile Doctors Off Mute deserves more than 22 subscribers

Use "Dr. Law" - it's more professional and formal. And yes, let's mention the subscriber count as it makes our pitch more relevant.

Here's how I'd phrase it:

"Loved your recent episode with Dr. Paschal. His point about giving teams permission to fail being the key to innovation - really clicked.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

Dr. Law, Smile Doctors Off Mute deserves way more than 22 subscribers.

[Continue with standard template...]"

The "way more than" feels more conversational than just "more than". Would you like me to continue with the full email?

Me

that was perfect!

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

again this time, I am sendin you all the pointers, since I am a bit confused as in what angle to choose.

yt title: Speak Easy Dental: Ep -8: Jennifer Turner (Dental Hygienist Master)

yt desc: 
Speak Easy Dental is honored to have our first Dental Hygienist as a guest.
Dental Hygiene is an important aspect of any dental practice, but more importantly patients are starting to realize how important teeth cleaning is to your overall health. Jennifer Turner is a dental hygienist who has the gift of making this profession one of the most powerful aspects of dentistry. She is an international speaker, a teacher in improving the aspects of dental hygiene. Her resume is so impressive , that when you google her name it takes over 2 pages! Just recently she opened the Hygiene Headquarters( where she is the CEO) , a valuable service to make any hygienist and dental office not only productive, but to  do it with confidence .  We are extremely lucky , that Jennifer shares some valuable tips on Speak Easy......

Looking at these pointers, I see a powerful story about transformation and empowerment. Here are some conversational opening options:

"Loved your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her journey from being kicked out of college to becoming a dental hygiene master - that's the kind of story that needs to be heard."
"Your recent episode with Jennifer Turner was fantastic. Her story about going from 'rock bottom to believing in yourself' - that really hit home."
"Really enjoyed your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her transformation from college dropout to dental hygiene master - now that's an inspiring story."
I recommend going with the first one because:

It's direct and personal
Captures the dramatic transformation
Implies value for wider audience
Sets up our pitch about reaching more listeners
Maintains conversational tone while highlighting impressive content
Here's how it would flow:

"Loved your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her journey from being kicked out of college to becoming a dental hygiene master - that's the kind of story that needs to be heard.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

Speak Easy Dental deserves way more than [current subscriber count] subscribers."

Would you like me to continue with the full email using this opening?

Me

Loved your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her story from being kicked out of college to becoming a dental hygiene master is very inspiring (add something simpler, like, it's inspiring, blah blah)

does the term 'dental hygiene master' make sense? what's master? is it a legit thing? it sounds childish....

You're right on both counts! Let me refine it:

"Loved your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her story from being kicked out of college to becoming a leader in dental hygiene is truly inspiring."

OR

"Loved your episode with Jennifer Turner. Her journey from college dropout to dental hygiene industry leader is truly inspiring."

The changes:

Removed "dental hygiene master" (you're right, it sounds unprofessional)
Used more accurate terms like "leader" or "industry leader" (she's CEO of Hygiene Headquarters and an international speaker)
Kept it simple with "truly inspiring" as the closer
Maintained conversational tone while being more professional
Which version do you prefer? We can also refine further if needed!

Me


that was perfect!

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

again this time, I am sendin you all the pointers, since I am a bit confused as in what angle to choose.

DSOs: Invest in educational platforms and mentorship programs to enhance clinician satisfaction and retention.
General: Embrace technological advancements and focus on delivering consistent value to both patients and partners.

### **Significant Insights**

- **Cost-Efficiency Through AI:**
    
    - **[00:15:36]**  
        _"we switched to Ai and I would say we cut our costs probably a tenth of what we were spending to have people do it and is it as good it's pretty darn close so it's amazing that you know the technologies that you can use really as a small business for sure to be to be lean."_
- **Importance of Educational Platforms for DSOs:**
    
    - **[00:19:14]**  
        _"education it's again kind of back really full circle here from what we discussed early on in the podcast is you know this is an expectation you know again kind of it's you don't it's not it's you don't it's not a I have to have at this point some type of educational platform regardless of the size of your group if you're looking to recruit new clinicians if you're bringing in a a new practice that was acquired into the fold."_
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a Critical Metric:**
    
    - **[00:49:54]**  
        _"our most important metric is our net promoter score he goes if where patients aren't happy you know then nothing else works."_

---

### **Advice on Core Values**

- **Adaptability and Logical Strategy for Vendors:**
    
    - **[00:38:39]**  
        _"if you're an old line publisher and you were geared to so solo practitioners you've got the print component you've got these huge costs you've got this thing called print and you can't prove ROI and I know people are not doing mag magazine ads anymore if they are it's it's it's in conjunction with digital and the fact that we don't have that is huge it's it's really hard to kind of turn not only a model like that around to go digitally but then change the focus of your audience from solo to DSO."_
- **Embracing Specialized Private Group Practices:**
    
    - **[00:38:39]**  
        _"private group practice [...] it's a good definition [...] that's where the real opportunity is and you can you can if I was a vendor that didn't like dsos I could see myself moving easier to servicing a private group practice and going from a solo to somebody that has a thousand locations so that might be a good first step."_

---

### **Personal Stories**

- **Facing Resistance at a Dental Event:**
    
    - **[00:34:00]**  
        _"I went into the lion's den the L's den and had no idea and just got I didn't prepare for it because I thought maybe they had gotten over it but the interesting thing is that yeah some of the PE individuals that were you know angry you know about the margin compression and dsos and making their job more complicated and whatever it is we work with their companies but we're working with their you know their special markets DSO people that understand so that's kind of the ironic thing is even internally at these big companies there's like you know the old school right the people that have seen the industry when it was you know solo and then the newer people that have come in and have learned how to navigate successfully you know the market and provide services to it so it's just it's it's really fascinating."_
- **Challenges with DSO Conferences:**
    
    - **[01:04:11]**  
        _"so yeah we have to appreciate though the person who's trying to sell you the marketing package is definitely not the same person that beat you up on price for the for your software right like it's a huge organization it just it's frustrating that's the thing like it is a little on our side it's not that we don't want to it's just almost an impossibility to say yes unless we are you know at the same half a billion dollar level that you guys are at."_

make it more conversational, more natural, imagine person A speaking to person B, will they talk like this?

Ah yes, let's make it more natural! How about:

"Really enjoyed your chat with the Group Dentistry team. Mind-blowing how AI cut their costs to just 1/10th of what they were spending before."

Or even more conversational:

"Loved your chat with the Group Dentistry folks. Pretty wild how they cut costs to 1/10th just by switching to AI."

Both versions:

Sound like actual conversation
Use simpler language
Feel more natural
Remove formal words like "traditional spending"
Add reactions people would actually say ("mind-blowing", "pretty wild")
Use casual terms like "folks" or "team" instead of "guys" (more professional but still casual)
Which tone feels more natural to you? We can refine further!

Me

ah yes, the second one is just perfect!

Perfect! Here's how the full email would flow:

"Loved your chat with the Group Dentistry folks. Pretty wild how they cut costs to 1/10th just by switching to AI.

also, mention the quote you're getting the pointer from

Looking at these pointers, I see a powerful story about transformation. The most compelling quote is from [00:01:27]: "Started my own practice in 2014 it was a you know it was your your startup like I bought a dump it was cheap and, you know, I turned it around I worked really really hard."

Here are some conversational openings:

"Loved your chat with Dr. Theis. Pretty inspiring how he turned a 'dump' of a practice into something special."
"Really enjoyed your episode with Dr. Theis. That story about buying a cheap, run-down practice and transforming it - that's the kind of real talk we need more of."
"Loved your chat with Dr. Theis. His journey from buying a 'dump' practice to building something amazing - that's the kind of story dentists need to hear."
I recommend the first one because:

Most conversational
Uses his actual word ("dump") which makes it authentic
Keeps it simple and natural
Sounds like something you'd actually say to someone
Sets up our pitch perfectly
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this opening?

Me

Ah yes, let's make it more specific! How about:

"Loved your chat with Dr. Theis. Pretty inspiring how he turned a 'dump' of a practice into a full-arch success story."

OR

"Loved your chat with Dr. Theis. Pretty inspiring how he turned a 'dump' of a practice into a thriving implant center."

Both versions:

Keep the casual, conversational tone
Replace vague "something special" with specific achievements
Reference his specialty (full-arch/implants)
Stay authentic with his word "dump"
Show we actually understood his business
Which version feels better? We can refine further if needed!

yt title: Getting New Patient Leads Is Science, Converting Them Is an Art

yt desc: If you’re relying on marketing alone to bring in new patients, then you’re missing a HUGE piece of the puzzle: lead conversion.

Lead generation and lead conversion are two completely different things, and this means they need completely different strategies. 

To discuss this in more depth, I’ve invited an expert on this week’s episode of the Raving Patients Podcast.

His name is Jake Goates and he is the founder of GOAT Marketing Consultants and a seasoned expert in dental marketing and sales strategy.

In the last decade, Jake has helped countless practices turn simple leads into loyal patients by implementing smarter systems, better accountability, and proven sales techniques.

In this episode, Jake and I will be discussing how dental practices can convert leads into patients, Jake’s “Goat Method”, the best ways to handle patient objections, why you need accountability measurements, and so much more.

Are you ready?

Let’s dive in.

'''
also, mention the quote you're getting the pointer from

Looking at these pointers, the most compelling quote is from [00:05:49]: "People believe that marketing equals new patients and that's just not true... marketing equals leads and then lead management equals new patients."

Here are some conversational openings:

"Loved your chat with Jake Goates. That point about marketing only getting you leads, not patients - hit the nail on the head."
"Really enjoyed your episode with Jake. His take on marketing vs. lead management was spot-on - marketing gets leads, but it takes more to get actual patients."
"Loved your chat with Jake from GOAT Marketing. Pretty eye-opening how he breaks down the difference between getting leads and getting patients."
I recommend the first one because:

Most conversational
Gets straight to the point
Uses natural language ("hit the nail on the head")
Captures the key insight simply
Sounds like something you'd actually say

4. **On the Role of APIs in Integration:**

### **Advice on Core Values**

    > — _Rory Goff_
    
2. **On Transitioning to Digital Payments:**
    
    > "In 2017-18, dentists were starting to ask us about Stripe and PayPal... that was when the idea for Patient Payments was confirmed in my head. We started by adding it as an additional service to our Dental Marketing business."  
    > — _Rory Goff_
    
3. **On Initial Success and Growth:**
    
    > "We approached orthodontic clinics initially and switched them from standing orders to direct debits. That first product worked really well, and we've grown to work with 50-60 clinics, processing millions of euros and pounds every year."

4. **On Personal Work-Life Balance:**
    
    > "I'm able to fit everything in because we have remote working hubs around Ireland. I work five minutes from where I live, allowing me to enjoy time with my wife and three kids while managing my businesses."

umm...may be no, go for something else, something which is more persuasive, this is too technical

wai! yk what! let's go with but you denifnitely need to phrase it better...may be show some curiosity


so the agnle I am thinking about is like, I never knew there was a thing like payments but just for dentists (or whatever it is) - that's so niche! and then we go with

"Which makes it clear to me that [porcast name] goes deeper than most dental content out there."

how does that sound?

Yes! That's a much better angle! Here's how we could phrase it:

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

again this time, I am sendin you all the pointers, since I am a bit confused as in what angle to choose.

mention the quote and angle you're choosing

<context>
**Significant Insights:**

1. **"Purpose is the bigger word. Purpose is personal and it's associated with who you are and often being related to your values."**
    
2. **"In business terms, purpose is all about your mission."**
    
3. **"When we lack purpose, we simply don't know what we're doing let alone why we're doing it."**
    
4. **"A goal is an objective and we set that and then we strive for that objective, right? It has to be aligned with our purpose."**
    
5. **"Our purpose does not serve our goals, it helps us create them. It helps us be the person that we want to be."**
    
6. **"When you are rock solid in purpose, you can focus on the right things and get where you want to go."**
    
7. **"All of these topics are actually great individual goals for a dental practice but they're not the main goal and purpose of a dental business."**
    
8. **"These skills and abilities are needed for success but they do not reflect the actual goal and purpose of any business."**
    
9. **"The goal of every business is simply to make money. Profitable money. That's the goal."**
    
10. **"All those topics that I read to you are sub-goals of the main goal."**
    
11. **"I can attest to all of you that money does not buy happiness but profitability one procedure at a time will change your world."**
    

---

**Advice on Core Values:**

1. **"Every practice, every dentist, and every team member needs a reason for being."**
    
2. **"The answer to the purpose question will effectively drive your personal choices and decisions."**
    
3. **"Not staying focused on your purpose is a showstopper."**
    
4. **"I want to place emphasis on the word focus. When we focus on our goals and purpose in the workplace, it leads to better employee performance, increased productivity, and improved business outcomes."**
    
5. **"Be teachable, my friends, and the MPMB team will take you the rest of the way."**
    
6. **"You deserve to be paid fairly for the services you provide and yes it can be easily accomplished even with PPO plans."**
    
7. **"You can accomplish your goals and purpose in your dental business and in your life. You just need to learn how."**
    

---

**Personal Stories:**

1. **"I learned the answer a few years ago as I was reading a book my sweetheart Tracy, she was required to read it in one of her MBA classes, and the book is appropriately titled 'The Goal'."**
    
2. **"I watch colleagues work towards the mastery of these subjects and do very well with them yet they still struggle with the main goal and purpose of their dental businesses."**
    
3. **"Wonderful dental colleagues find themselves tearfully asking why they can't live the dental dream they were promised in dental school. They ask themselves why they have chosen dentistry as a career. Their stress level has contributed to a state of depression and they don't know how to pull themselves out of it. Some have even shared thoughts of giving up on life and that breaks our hearts."**

yt title: Goals vs. Purpose

yt desc:e hear the words “goals” and “purpose” used frequently in business classes and corporate leadership training, but do we really know what they mean and how they are the same or different?

This quote is compelling because:

It's universally relatable
States a complex truth simply
Highlights a common pain point
Connects purpose to practical outcomes
Perfect setup for our pitch about clarity and direction
Here's how I'd open:

"Loved your episode on goals vs. purpose. That line about not knowing what we're doing without purpose - hit home pretty hard.

It's clear to me that what you're creating in this niche goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?..."

The opening works because:

Uses natural language ("hit home pretty hard")
Shows genuine connection to the content
Avoids corporate jargon

"It's clear to me that The Fixed Podcast shares more authentic stories than most dental content out there."
"It's clear to me that The Fixed Podcast cuts through the surface-level stuff most dental content puts out there."
"It's clear to me that The Fixed Podcast tells the stories that matter, not just the usual dental content out there."
I think #3 works best because:

"Authentic stories" matches the personal, real nature of Dr. Nekky's episode
Feels natural, not forced
Emphasizes the human element
Sets up our pitch about reaching more people
Aligns with the show's style of honest conversations

**Significant Insights:**

1. **"Team compensation is important because it typically makes up somewhere between 25% and 30% of the overall overhead."**
    
2. **"We can generally tell if a practice is in or out of line in profitability pretty quickly by looking at team overhead."**
    
3. **"I don't like goals. Goals is a one-point number. I like windows, like I like a margin or a window of numbers."**
    
4. **"When you're in growth mode, you're going to be more towards 25% to 30%. When you're in optimize mode, you're going to be more towards 20% to 25%."**
    
5. **"It's way easier to get it dialed when you're smaller than it is to grow the chaos and then try to optimize the chaos."**
    
6. **"The majority of us out there have an under-producing issue, not a team compensation issue."**
    
7. **"At some point, you're going to have to find a way to give your people more money because they don't want to just work harder and make the same."**
    
8. **"If you're a doctor with any sort of advanced skill set... your benchmark numbers should be at least $80,000 a month."**
    

---

**Advice on Core Values:**

1. **"I would rather get 25% of $2 million than 17% of $1 million or $1.5 million."**
    
2. **"You can't optimize hygiene or increase production that much, frankly speaking."**
    
3. **"At some point, you're going to have to paint a picture of how your team members can have a pathway to more money."**
    
4. **"You cannot implement and pay out a bonus if you're above 30%. You can't."**
    
5. **"We can't be held back by our mindset and how we start to look at our practices analytically and data-wise."**
    
6. **"Think of growth as a chart that goes up, plateaus, up, plateaus—it's a dance, it's a balance."**
    
7. **"Most likely, you have to find a way to out-produce your problem versus trying to save yourself."**
    

---

**Personal Stories:**

1. **"I just worked with a doctor on a call. He's about $120,000 a month, and his overhead's about 33%."**
    
2. **"I've got associates one year out of school, two years out of school, etc., that can routinely hit these numbers within the systems that we have."**
    
3. **"I look at that as a business owner, I'm like, well, that's two dentists doing 50. That's a dentist doing 50 grand out of each chair. That's not very good."**
    
4. **"I don't know about you, but I don't want that strategy—so at some point, you're going to have to paint a picture of how your team members can have a pathway to more money."**
    
5. **"What I did, which I don't recommend, is you just try to grow exponentially—grow, grow, grow—and you never plateau. You'll burn yourself out."**

yt title: Mastering Practice Profitability and Production - Millennial Dentist Podcast

yt dec: In this episode, I’m breaking down how to diagnose if you’re over-teamed or under producing and what to do about it. If you’ve got an advanced skill set—whether it’s ortho, implants, grafting, or molar root canals—you should be hitting at least $80,000 a month in production. If not, there are fundamental issues to address, and we’ll start by looking at team compensation, which should fall between 20-30% of collections. I’ll walk you through how to calculate this, including salaries, benefits, and taxes, and explain why focusing on major overhead areas is far more impactful than obsessing over saving a few bucks on supplies. Let’s dig into the metrics that will help you optimize your practice and boost profitability.

Looking at these pointers, the most powerful quote is: "It's way easier to get it dialed when you're smaller than it is to grow the chaos and then try to optimize the chaos."

This is compelling because:

Offers practical wisdom
Uses simple language for a complex concept
Relatable to any practice size
Shows preventive thinking
Perfect setup for our pitch about optimizing early
Here's how I'd open:

"Loved your episode on practice profitability. That point about fixing systems while you're small rather than trying to optimize chaos later - that hit close to home.

It's clear to me that Millennial Dentist shares more authentic stories than most dental content out there.

My concern?..."

The opening works because:

Uses natural language
Shows appreciation for practical advice
Sounds like actual conversation
Relates to a common pain point
Sets up our pitch about helping more dentists discover these insights
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this opening?

Me

That point about fixing systems while you're small rather than trying to optimize chaos later - that hit close to home --- make it way simpler

Ah yes! Here are simpler versions:

"Loved your episode on practice profitability. That line about fixing systems early before chaos sets in - makes so much sense."
"Loved your episode on practice profitability. Pretty smart how he emphasizes fixing systems while you're small - way easier than dealing with chaos later."
"Loved your episode on practice profitability. His take on fixing systems early vs. dealing with chaos later - that really clicked."
The last one might work best because:

Most conversational
Gets the point across simply
Uses natural language ("really clicked")
Sounds like something you'd actually say
Maintains the insight without being wordy
Which version feels more natural to you? We can refine further!

Me

that was perfect!

Now let's start with our next email:

For the very first personalized line I want you to consider only these pointers this time: 

1. **Professional Background and Experience**
    
    - _"My name is Dr. Radad. I am a practicing dentist in New Jersey and I am the owner of Don Blanch Denel, one of the most luxurious dental offices in the US."_
    - _"I've been practicing Dentistry for over 20 years now."_
    - _"I'm licensed to practice in New Jersey as well as in Canada and Egypt."_
    - _"I've been doing Dentistry for the longest time and I love it. I have a lot of knowledge that I want to share with you guys."_

details about her recent video: When it comes to front teeth injuries, there are a few different types of trauma we see frequently:
Chipped Teeth: These are usually the least severe and happen when a small part of the enamel breaks off.

Fractured Teeth: A bit more serious than a chip. Fractures can affect not just the enamel, but also the dentin and sometimes even the pulp inside the tooth.

Tooth Movement (Displacement): Sometimes, the tooth is pushed out of its normal position. It may feel loose or pushed inward or outward.

Avulsed Teeth: In the most serious cases, the tooth can be completely knocked out of the socket. This is a true dental emergency where time is critical."

Immediate Actions After Tooth Trauma
Let’s talk about what to do immediately if you experience any of these types of trauma. No matter the type, acting fast is essential to increase the chance of saving the tooth.

'''

so I am thinking about the agnle that, yk she has loads of experience and it won't be good if that goes to waste....or it would be waste if people don't caome across her knowledge

Yes! Let's focus on her valuable experience and knowledge-sharing angle. Here's how we could open:

"Loved your video on dental trauma. With 20+ years of experience across three countries, your insights on emergency dental care are too valuable not to reach more people.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes beyond typical dental content out there.

My concern?..."

OR even better:

"Loved your video on dental trauma. Twenty years of dental experience across three countries - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes beyond typical dental content out there.

My concern?..."

The second version works better because:

More conversational
Highlights her unique value proposition
Implies the need for wider reach naturally
Sounds like actual conversation
Sets up our pitch perfectly
Would you like me to continue with the full email using this opening?

Me

this wa sperfect!

can you tell me a better way to phrase 'Here's the results our clients got'

give me variatiosn

Here are some more engaging ways to introduce client results:

"Just look at what's possible..."
"Here's what happened when other creators took this step..."
"To give you an idea of what's achievable..."
"These numbers speak for themselves..."
"Let me show you what's working for others..."
"Want to see what's possible? Check this out..."
"Here's what we've helped others achieve..."
"The proof is in the numbers..."
"Take a look at these transformations..."
"Speaking of results..."
I think #1 "Just look at what's possible..." works best because:

Creates curiosity
Sounds natural and conversational
Implies potential without being pushy
Transitions smoothly into metrics
Has an optimistic tone
Would you like me to suggest more variations or would you like to see how any of these would flow in the full email?

Me

ok that was perfect, now let move onto the next email:

we'll use the same 'experience' and 'competence' angle

about him: With over 32 years of dental experience, he has developed a simple, practical, and incredibly effective way of increasing the number of patients you see… the amount of money you charge… and the percentage of large case revenues your patients will happily accept.

In some cases, Moffet’s strategy has resulted in over $100,000 in additional cash flow in just weeks. All you need is a decent team and his secret weapon, “The Ultimate Patient Experience TM.”

The UPE is a unique, low-cost system of unique patient engagement that is incredibly easy to put in place. In fact, one of Moffet’s strategies costs less than $40 to implement, and you can have it up and running by the end of business, today.

The Ultimate Patient Experience has allowed Dr. Moffet to:

Sell his dental practice for a cool $2.75 million – for which he collected 80% in cash, 20% in stock…
Consistently increase his prices (10.55% per year, on average) while retaining over 90% of his patients…
And DOUBLE his cold phone conversion rates, using a strategy that will take you less than 10 minutes to set up…
Inside these pages, you’ll discover exactly how Dr. Moffet accomplished each of these things, and how you can, too.


'''

and just to lyk for the previous email, this is what I went with:

Twenty years of dental experience across three countries - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about.

There's no denying that what you're creating in this dental space goes well beyond the typical.

My concern?

There's so much more room to help The Wonder Tooth Podcast expand and attract its ideal audience.

Better video work, episode trailers, videos repurposed into LinkedIn posts, click-worthy thumbnails, and short-form content – we take care of it all.

These numbers speak for themselves:
- Stevan Kospetin: Increased by 28k+ subscribers in 3 weeks
- Yogire: Drew in 11k+ followers and 7M+ views in 3 months
- MO Syed (KSI and Sidemen): Grew from 0 to 43.5k followers in 5 months

Case Studies

Let me know if you'd like more info! Thanks!
'''


Perfect! Let's craft an opening for Dr. Moffet using the experience/competence angle, but with a focus on his proven business success:

"Loved learning about your Ultimate Patient Experience system. Thirty-two years of experience culminating in a $2.75M practice sale - that's the kind of expertise dentists need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental business content out there.

My concern?..."

OR even better:

"Loved learning about your Ultimate Patient Experience system. Three decades of experience distilled into a $40 system that transformed your practice into a $2.75M sale - that's the kind of expertise dentists need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental business content out there.

My concern?..."

The second version works better because:

Highlights the contrast between low investment ($40) and high return ($2.75M)
Shows immediate practical value
Emphasizes both experience AND results
More specific and compelling
Sets up our pitch perfectly for helping more dentists discover this system

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental business content out there.

I can't help but notice

There's so much else that can be done to help The Ultimate Dental Podcast grow and reach its ideal audience craving for content like this.

I noticed your episodes are getting 15-30 views right now.

With some strategic tweaks, I can easily see you 3-5x that number.

Better video production, engaging episode intros, compelling thumbnails, videos repurposed into LinkedIn posts and short-form content – we do it all.

Here's what we've helped others just like you achieve:

let's start with another email: 

Abt gary tackas: Gary Takacs has over 43 years of experience in the dental industry. Since 1980, he has consulted with more than 2,200 dental practices, focusing on practice management and reducing insurance dependence. 
DENTIST ADVISORS
 He is also the founder of the Reducing Insurance Dependence Academy.

we're goigng ith basically the same angle, experience and competence

Here's the opening, focusing on his extensive experience and specific expertise:

"Loved your content on insurance independence. Four decades of experience helping 2,200+ practices break free from insurance dependence - that's the kind of expertise dentists need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental business content out there.

My concern?..."

This works well because:

Highlights both duration (40 years) and scale (2,200+ practices)
Focuses on his specific niche (insurance independence)
Uses concrete numbers to establish credibility
Sounds conversational yet professional

Perfect! thank you so much!

let's move on to our next email:

for some tiem I want to stop using the method of going through their first podcast episode and making it personalised that way because tbh I don't actually care about dentistry, what I care about is their knowledge and their nuanced insights reaching to the people who care about content like the one they publish, rather what I am focusing on right now is the angle of talking abot their expeirence and competence --- am I right with this approach?

so this podcast consists of two hosts, one owns 'Energize Group Dental Marketing' and the other is a Multi Dental Practice Owner, and they talk about a variety of topics and so how do I frame this?

Subject line: Matt & Andrew, Dental Unfiltered deserves more than just audio listeners

When a dental marketing expert who's achieved 246% patient growth teams up with a dentist who's scaled 4 practices to $1.2M+ in their first year - that's the kind of expertise more dental professionals need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental business content out there.

I can't help but notice: While hitting 50,000 downloads in 6 months is impressive, Dental Unfiltered is currently audio-focused.

do you think, this is too harsh: 'Despite having 654k subscribers, your videos are averaging 2-3k views'

Yes, that does sound a bit harsh and could come across as critical. Let's rephrase it more constructively:

Instead of: "Despite having 654k subscribers, your videos are averaging 2-3k views."

We could say:

"I noticed your recent videos are reaching 2-3k of your 654k subscribers. There's so much potential to connect with more of your existing audience."
OR

"With an impressive 654k subscribers, we could help your amazing content reach even more of your existing audience (your recent videos are connecting with 2-3k viewers)."
OR

"With a community of 654k subscribers, we could help your valuable content reach more of your existing audience (currently averaging 2-3k views per video)."
The third option might work best because it:

Acknowledges her success ("community of 654k subscribers")
Frames it as an opportunity rather than a problem
Uses positive language ("valuable content")
Presents the numbers as context rather than criticism
Sets up our solution naturally

firstly, they have 2.11 k subs

second: that's the kind of innovation that matters. - can you rephrase this better,currently it sounds like a lot of words with no real meaning behind it, may be change the angle or framing, see what works?

Ah yes! Let me revise with the correct subscriber count and rephrase the opening. Here are some better options:

Subject line: Supreme Dental Podcast deserves more than 2.11k subscribers

Option 1: "When the first English-language dental podcast from Mexico helps thousands of international patients navigate their dental journey - that's making a real difference."

Option 2: "When the first English-language dental podcast from Mexico transforms how international patients approach dental tourism - now that's changing the game."

Option 3: "When the first English-language dental podcast from Mexico demystifies dental tourism for thousands of international patients - that's solving a real need."

The third option might work best because:

Focuses on the specific problem they're solving
Highlights their unique value proposition
Shows tangible impact
Uses more meaningful language
Sets up the rest of the email perfectly
Would you like me to show you the full email with any of these openings?

'When a dentist creates a platform helping colleagues achieve financial freedom through ethical investing - that's bridging a crucial knowledge gap in dental education.' - make it simpler please

Here are simpler versions:

"When a dentist helps colleagues master ethical investing - that's filling a gap most dental schools missed."
"When a dentist makes financial freedom accessible to other dentists - that's solving a real problem."
"When a dentist teaches colleagues the path to financial freedom - that's addressing a real need in dentistry."
The second option might work best because:

Most straightforward
Uses clearer language
Maintains impact without being wordy
Feels more conversational
Gets straight to the point
So the opening would read:

"When a dentist makes financial freedom accessible to other dentists - that's solving a real problem.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical financial content out there..."

Let me know if you'd like more info! Thanks!

P.S. Love how you're combining life coaching with dental practice management - that's exactly what the industry needs!

Would you like me to refine this further or adjust the subscriber count in the subject line?

Me

where;s the million dollar practices point out of every thing I have sent?

and use a better and more high impact point than 'helps others avoid burnout' - rather you could've completely removed this point

You're absolutely right - I apologize for making assumptions and adding information that wasn't provided. Let's revise the opening with what we actually know:

Subject line: Dr. Davis, Better Dental Life deserves more than [current] subscribers

When an Air Force dentist turned life coach helps dental professionals transform both their practices and personal lives - that's addressing dentistry's bigger picture.

OR simpler:

When a dentist combines two decades of practice ownership with life coaching to transform dental careers - that's addressing dentistry's bigger picture.

The second version might work better because:

Uses verified information
Focuses on his unique combination of skills
Highlights his extensive experience
Stays true to his actual expertise
Sets up the value proposition more accurately
Would you like me to show you the full email with the corrected opening?

Me

'that's addressing dentistry's bigger picture.' - this sounds fake, let's try something more authentic

may be just tell him something like: 'that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about.'

Ah yes, much better! Here's the revised opening:

Subject line: Dr. Davis, Better Dental Life deserves more than [current] subscribers

When a dentist combines two decades of practice ownership with life coaching to transform dental careers - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about.

It's clear to me that what you're creating goes well beyond typical dental content out there...

This works better because:

More authentic and straightforward
Uses proven language that we know works
No forced metaphors
Stays true to his expertise
Flows naturally into the next line
Would you like me to show you the full email with this improved opening?

Me

is this grammatically correc? 'A dentist combining two decades of practice ownership with life coaching to transform dental careers - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about.'

Let's analyze both versions:

Original: "When a dentist combines two decades of practice ownership with life coaching to transform dental careers - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about."

Alternative: "A dentist combining two decades of practice ownership with life coaching to transform dental careers - that's the kind of expertise more people need to hear about."

Both are grammatically correct, but they function slightly differently:

The "When" version creates a conditional statement
The direct version (without "When") makes it more immediate and punchy
I actually think your version (without "When") is stronger because:

More direct
More concise
Reads more smoothly
Feels more like a headline
Still maintains the impact
So yes, your version is grammatically correct and actually better! Would you like to see the full email with this improved opening?
